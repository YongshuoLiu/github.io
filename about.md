# About Me
<!--author-->

## Hobbies

I have a deep passion for cooking, with a particular interest in Chinese and French cuisine. I've pursued formal training in French cooking, even though my instructor was skeptical of my talent. If you're a fan of Chinese food, I'm confident you'll enjoy my culinary creations.

Other than that, I have a deep appreciation for tea, particularly Fuding white tea and Pu'er tea. I frequently spend afternoons in the park, savoring tea while reading books. I am also passionate about collecting tea sets, with a special fondness for the white porcelain from Dehua County and the blue and white porcelain from Jingdezhen.
