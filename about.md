# About Me
<!--author-->
I was born in [Jining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jining), which is roughly the midpoint between Beijing and Shanghai. 
## Education
Qingdao Agricultural University, B.E. Computer Science and Technology. Graduate in May 2023.
## Hobbies

I really enjoy aerobic exercise. Specifically, I enjoy road cycling with long distance running (although my knees no longer support me in this sport). If you are a fan of Team Jumbo-Visma, then we'll definitely be good friends.

Other than that, I also play some video games. I've been playing Dark Souls 3 a lot lately as well as Elden Ring, and there's no doubt that I'm a fan of Hidetaka Miyazaki. In the Chinese community, we usually call him "Mean Miyazaki(宫崎老贼)".

I am also a member of the Launchpad Astronomy translation team on the youtuber channel. My main job is to translate the videos that are allowed to be translated into Chinese and post them on the Chinese community [Bili Bili](https://space.bilibili.com/1679558358?spm_id_from=333.337.0.0).
