In this paper, a novel Multi-graph neural network combined with Cross-Attention (CA-MGNN) is developed to match ship trajectories from multi-source. The method employs graph coding techniques to process ship data into trace features and utilizes a Cross-Attention mechanism for many-to-many matching based on these features. The experimental results demonstrate that this method effectively matches and correlates multi-source ship trajectory data, providing more accurate trace information for subsequent data analysis.  
The research question for this paper was proposed by Jiangnan Zhang. I was responsible for constructing and cleaning the dataset, designing and implementing the model and experiments, and writing the majority of the paper, except for the introduction.  
The revised paper is currently under review.
