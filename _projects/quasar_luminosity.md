In this paper,we propose a time-aware LSTM (T-LSTM) single-ship trajectory model combined with the generative adversarial network (GAN) to predict multiple ship trajectories. These analysis methods are capable of directly analyzing AIS data and have demonstrated better performance in both single-ship and multi-ship trajectories. Our experimental results show that the proposed method achieves high accuracy and can meet the practical navigation requirements of ships.  
The issue addressed in this article was proposed by Jiangnan Zhang. I was responsible for designing and implementing the models and experiments, and I also authored the main parts of the paper, excluding the Introduction. Zhenxing Liu handled the data cleaning and preprocessing.

The experimental results indicate that our proposed method achieves high accuracy and meets the practical navigational requirements of ships.
